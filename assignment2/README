make query_tree

By typing 

make clean

You delete all .o files and executables.


query_tree.cc can be compiled with ./query_tree rebase210.txt. "input_part2a.txt" is already included in the code
on line 84 with "fin.open("input_part2a.txt") so there is no need to write it when compiling.

test_tree.cc can be compiled with ./test_tree rebase210.txt sequences.txt

test_tree_mod can be compiled with ./test_tree_mod rebase210.txt sequences.txt
